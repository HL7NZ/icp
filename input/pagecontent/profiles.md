### Profiles for use by PMS vendors

\
An ICP "Episode of Care" represents the period during which a contracted Integrated Care Pathways (ICP) supplier is providing a patient with treatment for a specific injury.

"Integrated Care Pathways" is a new type of service that Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) contracts suppliers for. It is a provider-managed pathway that commissions outcomes rather than specified treatments. Itâ€™s focused on moderate complexity client needs whereby healthcare providers are empowered with autonomy & agency to use their skill set to assist clients back to independence.

An ICP "Episode of Care" is also referred to as an "ICP Case". It runs from the point when the supplier has completed their triage assessment and decided to enter the patient into their ICP service, until the point at which the patient is exited from that service.

The ICP Observation/Measurement resource is used to provide clinical/functional measurement details to ACC. (AKA site-specific clinical measures and PROMs)

There are five ICP profiles available:
